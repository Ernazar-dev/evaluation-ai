# AI Assistant Platform

Educational management + AI coursework grading platform, rewritten from the original
Python/Flask app into a modern JavaScript stack:

- **Backend:** Node.js + Express + **Prisma** ORM on **PostgreSQL**
- **Frontend:** **React + Vite + Tailwind CSS + Ant Design**, with route-level `React.lazy` + `Suspense`
- **AI grading:** Gemini (multimodal, rubric-based) → OpenRouter → deterministic mock fallback

The three roles (student / teacher / admin) and the 9-section coursework grading logic are
preserved 1:1 from the original.

---

## What the app does

- **Students** enroll in a group, see their subjects and assignments, and submit coursework
  through an **11-step wizard**: upload the main document, then answer each of the
  **9 academic sections** in turn (section 4 renders a live formula preview, section 6 takes a
  flowchart image), then a final review page with a summary of every answer. When the teacher
  has defined their own rubric for the assignment, the wizard asks for *those* criteria instead,
  showing each one's weight and maximum score. An AI grader scores each criterion, applies
  weighted/penalty logic, and produces an overall score plus a written report. Each assignment
  may be handed in up to **3 times** and the best attempt is the one that counts. Students also
  track academic ratings (0–5) per subject, browse the grading **criteria** per subject, see
  their **group** roster and its assignments, get notifications (header bell + full page),
  download PDF reports, read shared literature, and consult an in-app **help** guide.
- **Teachers** create assignments through a **3-phase wizard** (basic info → conditions →
  preview), review submissions, see a **scores/students** table with a per-student results
  drawer, follow **student activity**, and manage literature with a download history.
- **Admins** manage users, groups, subjects, departments, news, settings, drill down
  **teachers → their groups → those groups' students**, view activity logs, platform-wide
  notifications, a student leaderboard, and platform stats.

### Languages

The UI ships in **Uzbek (default)** and **Russian**, switchable from the header/login page; the
choice is remembered in `localStorage` and the browser language is deliberately ignored so a fresh
visitor always lands on Uzbek.

The server is localized too: the client sends its language in `Accept-Language`, and
`backend/src/i18n/` translates API messages, AI feedback, and the grading prompts (so the model
answers in the student's language). Values that outlive the request — notifications and activity
logs — are stored as translation keys and rendered in whatever language the reader has selected.

---

## Attempts: three tries, the best one counts

A student may submit the same assignment up to **3 times** (`MAX_ATTEMPTS`). Every attempt is
graded on its own and kept, but only the **highest-scoring** one is the student's mark — so a
retry can raise a grade and can never lower it. Where a teacher has corrected an attempt, their
number is the one compared.

That single rule lives in `backend/src/utils/attempts.js` and is imported everywhere a grade is
read — assignment lists, ratings, averages, the leaderboard, teacher rosters and PDF reports —
so the same student cannot show a different mark depending on the page. The limit itself is
enforced server-side on submit (`POST /assignments/:id/submit` returns `400` on the fourth try);
the wizard only mirrors it so the student is not walked through a form that will be refused.

What each side sees:

- **Students** — remaining tries and their best score on the assignment list and in the submit
  wizard before they start writing; on a result page, which attempt they are looking at, whether
  it is the one that counts, and a link to the better one if it is not.
- **Teachers** — one row per student, not per submission: the row *is* the counting attempt,
  with the other tries hanging off it so an earlier one can still be opened to see what changed.

The originality check excludes a student's own earlier attempts, so resubmitting your own work
is not reported as copying.

## How grading works

A submission is graded in the background (the HTTP request returns `202` immediately)
by `services/gradingService.js`, which tries two engines in order:

**1. Gemini** (`geminiGrader.js`) — used whenever `GEMINI_API_KEY` is set. One multimodal
request carries the original PDF/DOCX *as a document*, the flowchart *as an image*, and the
student's written answers, judged against the assignment's rubric. Four things make the
result defensible rather than a black box:

- **Rubric-bound.** The model is given only the teacher's criteria, their weights and their
  score bands, and is forbidden from inventing criteria of its own.
- **Evidence required.** A JSON schema forces a verbatim quote from the work behind every
  score; where nothing supports it the model must return `NOT FOUND` and score near zero.
  The quote is shown to the teacher next to the mark.
- **Calibration.** The last five teacher corrections on that assignment travel in the prompt
  ("the AI said 72, the teacher said 58, noting …"), so the grader converges on that
  teacher's standard — no fine-tuning, and it improves with every correction.
- **Sampling.** `GEMINI_SAMPLES=3` averages three independent gradings and keeps the prose
  from the run nearest the average, which removes most run-to-run variance on borderline work.
  **Cost:** each sample is one API call and `GEMINI_VERIFY=true` adds one more, so `3` + verify
  means **four calls per submission**. That is affordable on a billed key and exhausts a free
  key's daily quota after a handful of submissions — past the quota every model in the fallback
  chain returns 429 and grading silently drops to the length-based mock. On a free key use
  `GEMINI_SAMPLES=1`. Quota is counted per model, so `GEMINI_FALLBACK_MODELS` should end on an
  older, less contended model (`gemini-2.5-flash`) that still answers when the newest does not.
- **Course knowledge base.** (`knowledgeBase.js`) Reference material for the subject — the
  textbooks/notes in the `data-fayl/` directory and any **Books** uploaded for the subject — is
  mined for the passages most relevant to each submission (dependency-free TF‑IDF retrieval) and
  handed to the grader as the authoritative source it must check factual correctness against. So
  a wrong claim ("OSI has 4 layers") is caught against the textbook, not just the model's own
  memory. **Accuracy grows as you add more books.** Drop files in `data-fayl/` (shared across
  subjects) or, once you serve more than one subject, in a sub‑folder named after the subject
  (`data-fayl/Tarmoq xavfsizligi/`). Tuned by `KB_ENABLED` / `KB_DIR` / `KB_MAX_CHARS`.

**2. Legacy** (`aiService.js` + `fuzzyLogic.js`) — the original per-section OpenRouter path,
used when Gemini is unconfigured or fails. Text-only, so it never sees the document or the
diagram. With no `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` either, it degrades to a mock grader that scores by
text length — fine for a demo, meaningless as a grade.

A teacher's own score always overrides the AI's: `overallScore` keeps the AI value for the
record, `teacherScore` is what counts everywhere a final grade is shown, and ratings follow
the corrected number.

## Originality check (anti-plagiarism)

Every submission is compared against **every submission ever made on the platform**, so one
student handing in another's work is caught. It runs alongside the grading, in
`services/plagiarismService.js`, in two stages:

**1. Fingerprint (all submissions, always).** The work is reduced to the set of hashes of its
overlapping 5-word sequences and stored on the submission. A new submission is compared
against that whole corpus in memory — no earlier text has to be re-read — which catches a
copied file, a re-uploaded work, or a few pasted paragraphs exactly. Formatting, case and
punctuation are normalised away, so renaming a heading changes nothing. Submissions made
before this feature existed are re-fingerprinted from their stored files as they are
encountered, so the corpus fills in by itself.

**2. AI verification (the closest candidates).** Shingles cannot see a *reworded* copy, and
they wrongly flag two students who quote the same textbook. So the closest candidates go to
Gemini, which reads both works and rules `copy` / `paraphrase` / `common_material` /
`independent` with verbatim passage pairs as evidence. It is explicitly told that a shared
report template, shared headings, standard definitions and the task wording are **not**
plagiarism. Its verdict decides the final figure whenever it runs.

Two different numbers are computed, because two different questions are being asked:

- **coverage** — how much of *this* work came from elsewhere. This is the reported figure and
  the only fair basis for a penalty: one pasted paragraph in an original work is not a copy.
- **detection** — the share of the *shorter* work found in the longer one. Used to rank
  candidates and to keep a small-but-total lift visible to the teacher.

What happens to the grade:

| Similarity | Result |
|-----------:|--------|
| `< 25%` | nothing — normal overlap for one subject |
| `25–39%` | warning in the report and a notification; **no** deduction |
| `≥ 40%` | grade scaled by `1 − similarity`, so 60% similar keeps 40% of the marks |
| identical file | 100%, grade goes to zero |

The student is warned ("you submitted work that has already been uploaded"), told what it
cost them, and shown their own matching passages — never the other student's name. The
teacher sees who was matched, both figures, the AI's verdict and both sides of every matched
passage, plus a **re-check** button for work graded before the source appeared in the corpus.
Re-checking is idempotent: the previous deduction is added back before the new one is worked
out, so the same overlap can never be punished twice.

Tuned by `PLAGIARISM_*` (see below); set `PLAGIARISM_ENABLED=false` to switch it off entirely.

## Local development

Requirements: **Node 18+** and a **PostgreSQL** database.

### 1. Backend

```bash
cd backend
cp .env.example .env         # then edit DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, ADMIN_*
npm install
npx prisma db push           # create tables
npm run seed                 # create the bootstrap admin + default settings
npm run dev                  # http://localhost:5000
```

### 2. Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev                  # http://localhost:5173 (proxies /api,/auth,/assignments to :5000)
```

### Accounts

There is **no self-registration and there are no demo accounts**. Seeding creates exactly
one user — the bootstrap admin — whose credentials come from `.env`:

```env
ADMIN_USERNAME=...
ADMIN_PASSWORD=...
```

Log in as that admin and create every teacher and student from **Admin → Users**; the admin
hands each person their login and password. Change `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env` before going
live (re-running `npm run seed` updates the admin's password to the current `.env` value).

---

## Deploy to Render (free tier)

This repo ships a **single-service** setup: the Express server also serves the built React
app, so you deploy one web service + one managed Postgres.

1. Push this folder to a GitHub repo (`git init && git add . && git commit && git push`).
   The Blueprint flow reads `render.yaml` out of a GitHub repo — there is no upload path.
2. Set `ADMIN_USERNAME`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD` and `GEMINI_API_KEY` in the Render dashboard
   **before** the first deploy — they are marked `sync: false` in `render.yaml`, which means
   Render will prompt for them. `GEMINI_API_KEY` is what turns on real grading; without it a
   deterministic mock grader is used, so the platform still runs but its scores mean nothing.
3. In Render: **New + → Blueprint**, select the repo (it reads `render.yaml`).
4. Render creates the Postgres DB and the web service, runs
   `npm run build && npm run db:push && npm run db:seed`, then `npm start`. Seeding runs on
   every deploy and is idempotent; it creates the one bootstrap admin you can log in as.
5. Log in as `ADMIN_USERNAME` and create the teachers and students from **Admin → Users**.

### What the free tier cannot do

- **Uploaded files do not survive a redeploy.** Render's free plan has no persistent disk, so
  `backend/uploads/` — every submitted document, flowchart and uploaded book — is wiped on each
  deploy and on the instance restarting after idling. The database rows survive, so grades,
  feedback and originality figures are all kept; it is the original files behind them that go,
  and "download submission" then returns *file not found*. A paid plan with a mounted disk at
  `backend/uploads` fixes it. The knowledge base is unaffected: `data-fayl/` is committed to git
  and so is restored with every deploy.
- **Schema changes need care.** `db:push` runs with `--accept-data-loss`, which is what lets a
  changed schema reach the deployed database at all. Run `npx prisma db push` locally *without*
  the flag first and read what it says it will drop.

### Why it won't "hang" on the free tier

- Every page is **code-split** with `React.lazy` + `Suspense`, so the browser only downloads
  the chunk for the current page (each page bundle is a few KB).
- Vendors (`react`, `antd`) are split into their own cacheable chunks, served `immutable` —
  their filenames carry a content hash, so they never need revalidating. `index.html` is served
  `no-cache`, so a redeploy is picked up on the next load rather than a stale shell being reused.
- A redeploy renames every chunk. A tab left open on the previous build asks for files that no
  longer exist; the server answers those with a **404** (not the SPA shell, which would hand
  JavaScript an HTML document and leave a blank page) and the client reloads once into the new
  build. See `lazyPage` in `App.jsx`.
- AI grading runs **fire-and-forget** after a submission — the HTTP request returns immediately
  (HTTP 202) and the result appears once processing finishes.
- A `/health` endpoint is provided for Render's health checks.

> **mock grader that scores by text length** — usable for a demo, not for real marking.

**Frontend** (`frontend/.env`): leave `VITE_API_URL` empty for the single-service deploy;
set it only if you host the frontend separately from the API.

## Notes on the migration

- SQLite → PostgreSQL (Prisma schema mirrors the original SQLAlchemy models, table/column
  names preserved via `@@map`/`@map`).
- Flask blueprints → Express routers with the **same URL prefixes** (`/auth`, `/assignments`,
  `/api/subjects`, `/api/users`, `/api/admin`, `/api/teacher`, `/api/literature`,
  `/api/notifications`).
- `services/ai_service.py` and `fuzzy_logic.py` are ported faithfully (same 9 sections, same
  weights, same penalty thresholds, same OpenRouter fallback chain + mock fallback).
- PDF generation switched from reportlab to `pdfkit` (Node).
- `.doc`/`.pptx` text extraction is simplified compared to the Python original; `.docx` uses
  `mammoth`. Extend `src/services/fileParser.js` if you need richer parsing.
